<!--in the beginning of the a tag there was a
href = "#" which caused the page to reload
every time a recipe was clicked. This was removed
to make the page not to send a request every time
a recipe was clicked and was replaced with a style
to change the cursor to indicate that the recipe is 
still a link-->

<!--bind routerlink to a relative path where i
add the recipe id after the /recipes route-->

<!--use routerlink = active to display the current
recipe that is selected-->
